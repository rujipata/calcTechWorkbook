\subsection*{Second Derivatives}
The derivative of a function $f$ is a function that gives information about the slope of $f$. The derivative tells us if the original function is increasing or decreasing. Because $f'$ is a function, we can take its derivative. This second derivative also gives us information about our original function $f$. The second derivative gives us a mathematical way to tell how the graph of a function is curved. \textbf{The second derivative tells us if the original function is concave up or down}.

\noindent For a given function $f(x)$, the $2^{nd}$ derivative, denoted by $f''(x)$ or $\dfrac{d^{2} y}{dx^2}$, is found by determining the derivative of $f'(x)$.

\noindent The (\emph{first}) derivative of a function $f$ is a function that gives information about the slope of f. \textbf{The (\emph{first}) derivative tells us if the original function is increasing or decreasing}.\\\\
Not all increasing (or decreasing) functions behave in the same manner. The second derivative allows us to examine in more detail how a function increases or decreases in an interval. Specifically, \textbf{the second derivative, tells us how fast the original function is increasing (or decreasing)}. See Example \ref{acceleration}.

\begin{example}\label{acceleration}
Let $s(t)=6t^3-81t^2+360t$ be the equation of the height (in feet) of a particle at time $t$ seconds.

\subsection*{Concavity}

The second derivative is important when we analyze graphs of functions and the behavior of functions. It gives us a mathematical way to tell how the graph of a function is curved. \textbf{The second derivative tells us if the original function is concave up or down.}\\\\
Graphically, a function is \textbf{concave up} if its graph is curved with the \textbf{opening upward} (a in the figure). Similarly, a function is \textbf{concave down} if its graph \textbf{opens downward}. Notice that a function can be concave up regardless of whether it is increasing or decreasing.

\textbf{An Epidemic:} Suppose an epidemic has started, and you, as a member of congress, must decide whether the current methods are effectively fighting the spread of the disease or whether more drastic measures and more money are needed. In the figure \ref{fig:epidemic}, $f(x)$ is the number of people who have the disease at time $x$, and two different situations are shown. In both (a) and (b), the number of people with the disease, $f(now)$, and the rate at which new people are getting sick, $f '(now)$, are the same. The difference in the two situations is the concavity of $f$, and that difference in concavity might have a big effect on your decision.\\

\noindent In (a), $f$ is concave \rule{2cm}{0.25mm}(\emph{up or down}) at "now", the slopes are \rule{4cm}{0.25mm}\\(\emph{increasing or decreasing}), and it looks as if it’s tailing off.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title={Law of Diminishing Returns\footnotemark[1]}]
In economics the \textbf{law of diminishing returns} says that anytime you increase one factor of production (e.g.  employees, machinery, fertilizer, etc) while keeping all other factors of production constant, eventually you will hit a \textbf{point of diminishing returns},where the incremental per-unit returns begin to drop.

\begin{example}
A company estimates that it will have the revenue R(x) from sales after spending $x$ on advertising their product, as given by
\begin{center}
    $R(x)=\displaystyle\frac{1}{10000}(300x^2-x^3)$,\hspace{10pt} $0\le x\le 200$
\end{center}
where the revenue $R(x)$ and the advertising cost $x$ are both measured in million of Euros.\\
Given the graph of $R(x)$ shown in figure \ref{fig:diminishR1} , answer the following questions.

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Using the \emph{Concavity Test}, show that the \textbf{point of diminishing returns} is the inflection point of $R$.
   \newpage
    \item \textbf{Fill in the blanks:} In the interval $(0,100)$, each additional Euro invested in advertising increases sale \rule{2cm}{0.25mm} (\emph{more or less}) than the previous Euro invested in advertising. The is because the slope of the curve is \rule{2cm}{0.25mm} (\emph{increasing or decreasing}) on $(0,100)$.\vfill
    \item \textbf{Fill in the blanks:} In the interval $(100,200)$, the slope of the curve is \rule{2cm}{0.25mm} (\emph{increasing or decreasing}) and each additional Euro invested in advertising increases sale \rule{2cm}{0.25mm} (\emph{more or less}) than the previous Euro invested in advertising.\vfill
    \item If the company currently put 100 millions of Euros in advertising, would you recommend the company to invest more on the advertising? Why or why not?\vfill
\end{enumerate}
%%short answer
    \begin{sol}
    (a) concave up on $(-\infty,100)$; concave down on $(100,\infty)$; Change in concavity at $x=100$ $\Longrightarrow$ inflection point at $x=100$. (b) more;increasing (c) decreasing;less (d) no.

\subsection*{Second Derivative Test for Extremes}
\noindent The concavity of a function can also help us determine whether a critical point is a maximum or minimum or neither. For example, if a point is at the bottom of a concave up function, then the point is a minimum (see figure \ref{fig:oneLocalExtrema}). 
\begin{tcolorbox}[title={The Second Derivative Test for Extremes:}]
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Find the \textbf{domain} of $f$.
    \item Find all \textbf{critical numbers} of $f$.
    \item For those critical points where $f'(c)=0$, find $f''(c)$.
    \item Locate any \textbf{local extrema} by determining the sign of $f''(c)$ as follows:
    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
        \item If $f''(c)<0$ then $f$ is \textbf{concave down} and has a \textbf{local maximum} at $x=c$.
        \item If $f''(c)>0$ then $f$ is \textbf{concave up} and has a \textbf{local minimum} at $x=c$.
        \item If $f''(c)=0$ then $f$ may have a local maximum, a minimum or neither at $x=c$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
\begin{example}
\noindent Given $f(x)=x+\displaystyle\frac{100}{x-1}$, determine all \textbf{local extrema} by using the \emph{Second Derivative Test for Extremes} as described above. You may use the \emph{critical numbers} of $f$ that were already found in part c of Example \ref{1stDervTestLocal_ex7}. Compare your results to the results from using \emph{First Derivative Test for Extremes} in the example. 
%%short answer
    \begin{sol}
    local max at $x=-9$; local min at $x=11$; same results.
    \end{sol}
