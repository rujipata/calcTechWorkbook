\noindent We have seen that for quantities that are changing over time, the rates at which these quantities change are given by derivatives. If two related quantities are changing over time, the rates at which the quantities change are related. For example, if a balloon is being filled with air, both the radius of the balloon and the volume of the balloon are increasing. In lesson \ref{implicitDiff} ,Â  we consider several variables or quantities are related to each other and some of the variables are changing at a known rate. Then, we study how to determine the relationship between the rates of change of these quantities by using derivatives to determine how rapidly the other variables must be changing.

\subsection*{Application Using The Chain Rule: Related Rates}
%%%From the "Related Rates" box in Applied Calculus by Calaway;Chapter 2 section 11 Implicit Differentiation and Related Rates%%%
\begin{tcolorbox}[title = {Strategy for Finding Related Rates}]
When working with a related rates problem,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the quantities that are changing, and assign them variables.
    \item Find an equation that relates those quantities.
    \item Differentiate both sides of that equation with respect to time.
    \item Plug in any known values for the variables or rates of change.
    \item Solve for the desired rate.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

%%Example from Dave's handout 'Implicit Differentiation and Related Rates'

\begin{example}
Suppose the $x$ and $y$ are functions of another variable $t$, and $x$ and $y$ are related by the equation $y^2=4+xy$. Use implicit differentiation with respect to $t$ to determine $\dfrac{dy}{dt}$ in terms of $x,y,$ and $\dfrac{dx}{dt}$.
\vspace*{\stretch{1}}
    %%short answer
    \begin{sol}
    $\dfrac{dy}{dt}=\dfrac{y}{2y-x}\cdot \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

%%Example from Dave's handout 'Implicit Differentiation and Related Rates'

\begin{example}
The volume, $V$, of a spherical cancer tumor is given by $V=\dfrac{1}{6}\pi x^3$, where $x$ is the diameter of the tumor.  A physician estimates that the diameter is growing at the rate of 0.4 millimeters per day at the time when the diameter is $x=10$ mm. (NOTE that both $x$ and $V$ are changing with respect to time, $t$.)  Determine the \textbf{rate} at which the volume of the tumor is changing at this point in time.
