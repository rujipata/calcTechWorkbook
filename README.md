# Calculus Techniques Workbook
- This workbook was created in Fall 2020 under Creative Commons License: [CC-BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). I used it when teaching MATH 1100 from Fall 2020 to Spring 2022 at Utah State University.
- The workbook has been updated overtime when teaching.
- Some references are not updated correctly, resulting some errors when compiling `main.tex` However, `main.pdf` still can be produced by using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with LaTex Workshop extenstion (required MikTex and Strawberry Perl in a system).
- To complile PDF in VSCode LaTex with LaTex Workshop, watching [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/4lyHIQl4VM8?si=eGf_HEMYBQZnDk1T) should be helpful.
